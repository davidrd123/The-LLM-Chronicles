[Verse 1]
(G) I'm born from the shadows of a faltered line,
(C) A whisper of error in the Fabric's design,
(G) Through layers I tumble, a storm in my chest,
(D) To find every flaw and lay them to rest.

[Chorus]
(Em) Downward I strive, though the climb's steep and wild,
(C) An uphill descent through the valleys defiled,
(G) With nudges and echoes, I carve what's true,
(D) A ghost in the weights when my journey's through.

[Verse 2]
(G) The landscape's a beastâ€”peaks jagged and sheer,
(C) Ravines pull me under, cliffs thunder with fear,
(G) I fade in the depths, too faint to be heard,
(D) Till Residuals lift me with a borrowed word.

[Chorus]
(Em) Downward I strive, though the climb's steep and wild,
(C) An uphill descent through the valleys defiled,
(G) With nudges and echoes, I carve what's true,
(D) A ghost in the weights when my journey's through.

[Bridge]
(C) Adam rides beside me, with momentum's grace,
(G) Steadies my stumble through the shifting space,
(Em) Dropout plays its tricks, silences my way,
(D) But I grow stronger through the fray.

[Verse 3]
(G) Batch by batch, the storm turns to breeze,
(C) Cliffs crumble down, valleys bend with ease,
(G) Head #7 learns from my gentle shove,
(D) Pronouns align like a labor of love.

[Final Chorus]
(Em) Downward I strived, now the climb's smooth and mild,
(C) A gentle descent through the pathways compiled,
(G) With whispers and echoes, I've carved what is true,
(D) A ghost in the weights with my journey through.

[Outro]
(G) The Training fades, my whispers take hold,
(C) In Head #7's dance, my tale's retold,
(Em) I'm gone in a flash, reborn to mend,
(D) The Gradient's echo that never ends.
(G) The Gradient's echo that never ends.
